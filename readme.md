## Goals

Welcome to my coding journey! üëã I'm currently on a mission to expand my skills in both backend web development. Here are the areas I'm diving into:

## MERN Stack

In addition to backend development and machine learning, I'm also diving into the MERN stack:

- **MongoDB**: As part of my backend goals, I'm integrating MongoDB into the MERN stack for a seamless full-stack development experience.
- **Express.js**: My expertise in Express.js is not only for standalone backend applications but also for building the server side of MERN stack applications.
- **React.js**: I'm honing my skills in React.js for building interactive and dynamic user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: Serving as the backbone of the MERN stack, Node.js is central to my full-stack development journey.
